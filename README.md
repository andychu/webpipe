webpipe
=======

webpipe is server and a set of tools which bridge the Unix shell and the web.
You create files in a terminal (using [R][], a shell script, etc.), and they
will be rendered immediately in your browser.

It gets rid of the `Alt-Tab F5` dance when creating content.

[R]: http://r-project.org/

See webpipe.html for instructions on how to use it.
