- Copy latch server from Poly, and use the same static server pattern as
  webpipe.  I think latch should be a separate server for now.  If people care
  about auth, they could make an App file.  But we also want to be compatible
  with other servers.

  - have a latch for each filename.

  Usage:
  
  $ latch _tmp/doc

  # starts the server

- The server should take comments like this:

  <head>
    ...
  <!-- INSERT LATCH JS -->
    ...
  </head>

  <body>
    <div id="latch-status"></div>
  </body>

The JSON Template should have this comment in the <head> section, so that all
docs have it.


- Write a shell script like file-latch.sh

  It should take a hook, like
  
  file-latch.sh doc.sh *.txt

  Any time a .txt file is changed, then it will do the following:
  
  1) call out to 
  
  $ doc.sh index.txt
  
  Which can all make if it wants, but often a shell script will suffice.

  2) unhook the latch
    - should I curl it, or write to a pipe, reading from stdin?
    stdin is more


- Test the cases of:

  1) directly editing HTML
  2) editing .txt, having it built, and writng .html to _tmp

  I think you need two inotifywait processes.  One for txt, and one for HTML.
